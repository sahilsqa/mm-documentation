Introduction
Mera Monitor is a comprehensive productivity tracking and monitoring solution designed for
organizations that wish to efficiently manage and analyze team performance. This document
serves as a user guide, complete with definitions of key terms and detailed explanations of
workflows and functionalities. In this guide, “productivity” refers to the effective use of work
hours by team members, and “tracking” means the collection and analysis of various usage
metrics. Mera Monitor consolidates data such as active work hours, application usage, website
activity, and attendance patterns to offer a complete picture of organizational performance.
Getting Started
Organization Signup Process
Before using Mera Monitor, an organization must register on the official website. The signup
process has been simplified to enable organizations to try the platform risk-free for a 14-day trial
period. During registration, you will be asked to provide specific details. The key definitions and
instructions include:
● Admin Name: The designated person responsible for organizational setup and
management. This individual has the highest privileges on the platform.
● Organization Name: The official name of your company as registered.
● Work Email: A company email address (preferably with the corporate domain) that will
be used to send system notifications and verification codes.
● Phone Number: A contact number for further correspondence if needed.
● Password: A secure password that complies with the platform’s criteria.
After completing the registration form, an email is sent to the provided work email containing an
authentication code. This step, known as email verification, confirms that the email belongs to
the organization and that the account setup is secure. Once verification is complete, the
organization gains access to its personal Mera Monitor dashboard.
Dashboard Overview
The dashboard is the central hub for all activities within Mera Monitor. It is designed to present
critical information in a user-friendly format and is tailored based on different user roles. Below
are some definitions and detailed explanations of the dashboard features:
● User Access Levels:
Mera Monitor provides three distinct dashboard views that differ according to the user’s
role. At the highest level is the Organization Admin, who enjoys comprehensive
privileges and visibility across key performance indicators (KPIs). Other users have
access based on the role assigned by the admin, with limits on what data and functions
they can access.
● Real-time Monitoring:
The dashboard displays live data that helps admins monitor organizational activity. Key
metrics include:
○ Total Members: The overall count of active registered users within the
organization.
○ Currently Active Members: The number of users logged in and interacting with
the system at any given moment.
○ Offline Members Count: The number of registered users not actively logged in.
○ Time Tracking Metrics:
■ Total Active Hours: Sum of hours during which users are logged in.
■ Total Productive Hours: Hours recorded when users are engaged in
work-related activities according to the activity classification rules.
■ Total Non-Productive Hours: Hours logged during activities classified
as unproductive.
Admins can filter these metrics by selecting custom date ranges, thereby enabling historical
comparisons and trends analysis.
Productivity Tracking
Activity Classification
Mera Monitor allows Organization Admins to categorize applications and websites based on
their relevance to work output. The product differentiates between two primary types of
activities:
● Productive Activities: Applications and websites that contribute directly to
accomplishing work objectives (e.g., project management software, data analysis tools).
● Unproductive Activities: Applications or websites that are likely to distract from core
work tasks (e.g., non-work-related social media sites).
This classification is crucial for understanding team productivity patterns. When categorizing, it
is advisable to periodically review and update the classifications based on current work
processes and priorities.
Productivity Analytics
Once activities have been classified, Mera Monitor aggregates the data to provide various
analytical insights such as:
● Graphical Representations: Visual charts such as bar graphs that display the ratio of
productive versus non-productive hours over chosen date ranges.
● Performance Rankings:
○ Top 3 Performers: Users with the highest allocation of productive time.
○ Bottom 3 Underperformers: Users whose productive time is significantly lower
than their peers.
● Usage Analytics:
○ Top 5 Websites: The websites most frequently accessed across the
organization.
○ Top 5 Applications: The applications most commonly in use.
These analytics support data-driven decisions to improve workforce management and
encourage best practices.
Attendance Management
The Mera Monitor dashboard includes an attendance widget that provides a graphical view of
team attendance over time. Here, attendance is defined as the tracking of user login patterns
and overall activity levels during work hours. The attendance management section helps identify
trends such as absenteeism, peak hours, and overall team participation. This feature is
invaluable for HR departments and team leads to ensure accountability and consistent
engagement.
Member Management
Managing team members is a key component of the Mera Monitor platform. There are several
ways to add and manage members:
Adding Individual Members
Organization Admins can add members one at a time using the “Add Members” feature, which
is accessible via a button prominently located at the top of the dashboard. The process involves:
● Opening a dedicated member addition form.
● Required Field:
○ Email Address: Must be the work email where the invite will be sent.
● Optional Fields:
○ Name: The full name of the member.
○ Manager: The immediate supervisor responsible for the member.
○ User Access Type: Defines the role or privileges of the member.
○ Department: The team or department to which the member belongs.
After submitting the form, the system sends an invitation email to the new member. This email
contains a unique account activation link and instructions on setting a secure password. Only
after confirming the email and setting the password is the account activated.
Bulk User Upload
An alternative to the individual signup is the Bulk User Upload, which simplifies adding multiple
users in a single session:
● Process Flow:
○ Template Download: Download a sample template file from the system. This file
outlines the required format.
○ Data Entry: Fill in the details for each user:
■ Mandatory Field: Email
■ Optional Fields: Name, Manager, User Access Type, and Department
○ Upload Process: Upload the completed file back into the system.
● System Response:
○ A confirmation message displays the number of successfully added users.
○ Any errors in data format or invalid entries are highlighted, enabling corrections.
○ For all valid entries, the system automatically sends invitation emails containing
the account activation link and instructions for password setup.
User Invitation Management
Managing invitations is centralized in the platform. Key points include:
● Automated Emails: Once members are added (either individually or in bulk), automated
invitation emails are dispatched.
● Email Contents: Each invite typically includes the account activation link, detailed
instructions for setting up a password, and key organization details.
● Invitation Status: The system allows admins to track invitation statuses (sent, pending,
accepted) directly from the dashboard.
Department Overview and Administration
For better organizational segmentation, Mera Monitor offers department management features.
Here, departments help in grouping members based on teams, functions, or projects.
Department Overview
Within the admin dashboard, a dedicated section lists all active departments. Essential features
include:
● Search Functionality:
A search bar allows admins to locate departments by name, enabling quick access to
specific departments.
● Department Listing Details:
○ Department Name: The official title of the department.
○ Member Count: The number of team members assigned to each department.
○ Linked Member Details: Clicking on a department reveals detailed information
about the members associated with it.
Department Creation
Admins can create new departments using the “Add Department” function:
● Click the “Add Department” button.
● Enter the desired department name.
● Multiple departments can be created consecutively.
● Submission completes the department creation process.
Member Association
Once departments are created, members can be associated with relevant departments. The
workflow includes:
● From within the department view, clicking “Add Member” displays a list of unassigned
members.
● Admins select the appropriate members and confirm the association.
● Once associated, the department listing updates to reflect the new member allocations.
Department Administration
Department administration covers the entire lifecycle of department management, including:
● Creating and Editing Departments: Admins can add new departments or modify
existing ones to suit evolving organizational structures.
● Managing Member Associations: Admins have the capability to add or remove
members from departments and can reassign members as necessary.
● Search and Filter: Advanced filtering options allow admins to quickly locate
departments by name or other criteria.
General Settings Configuration Guide
This guide explains the configuration options available in the General Settings section of Mera
Monitor, the central control panel for managing the monitoring system. Mera Monitor is designed
to track user activity, manage recordings, and provide administrative insights. The following
sections detail each group of settings, their purposes, and best practices for configuration.
Screenshot Settings
Screenshot Interval
This setting determines how frequently the system captures images of the user’s screen to
create a visual log of activity. The interval is configurable from 1 to 100 minutes. For example, if
the interval is set to 1 minute, the system will capture one screenshot every minute when
monitoring is active. This feature is useful for troubleshooting and auditing, while ensuring that
the frequency is balanced against storage constraints.
Screenshot Blur Effect
This option applies a blur filter to captured screenshots to protect sensitive information. The blur
intensity is adjustable from 0 (no blur) to 3 (maximum blur). Choosing a higher blur value
safeguards confidentiality in environments where sensitive data might be exposed, without
completely obscuring the context of the activity.
Activity Monitoring
Capture Keyboard/Mouse Stroke
This parameter sets the interval, from 10 to 60 minutes, for logging keyboard and mouse
actions. A default interval of 10 minutes means that the system records user inputs every 10
minutes. This can be used for productivity tracking and security audits, though administrators
should keep privacy considerations in mind.
Idle Time Settings
This group of settings defines what is considered an "idle" state versus active user engagement:
● Idle Time Interval: Specifies the duration (5–100 minutes) after which a user is classified
as idle if no interaction is detected. For instance, a 5-minute setting implies that inactivity
beyond 5 minutes marks the user as idle.
● Idle Time Alert: Determines when an alert is triggered due to inactivity, adjustable
between 0 and 100 minutes. With a current setting of 10 minutes, notifications are
issued when a user remains idle for this duration.
● Active User Duration: Establishes the minimum period (10–60 minutes) needed to
consider a user's session as actively sustained. A setting of 35 minutes ensures that
continuous activity is differentiated from sporadic usage.
These settings help administrators define accurate active and idle thresholds from a productivity
and security standpoint.
Session Management
Session Expiry
This parameter defines the lifespan of a user session—ranging from 1 to 100 days—before the
session expires automatically. A default of 1 day ensures that sessions are regularly refreshed,
reducing security risks associated with prolonged access.
Recording Capture Duration
This setting controls the length of individual screen recording sessions, configurable between 5
and 30 minutes. A shorter duration (e.g., 5 minutes) produces smaller, more manageable video
files while preserving activity details for audits.
Time and Attendance
Cut Off Time
Specified in the format HH:MM:SS, this field sets the daily reset time for attendance records.
For example, a setting of 00:00:00 means the attendance log is reset at midnight.
Time Zone
This setting defines the time zone for all time-related data in the system. Default is set to India
Standard Time (IST), it ensures that timestamps and scheduled tasks correspond to the correct
regional time.
Attendance Hours Per Day
Entered in the format HH:MM:SS, this parameter defines expected working hours. A default
value of 00:00:00 indicates that the administrator should configure the specific working hours for
proper attendance tracking.
Working Days Per Week
This option lets administrators specify the official working days. For example, Monday to Friday
are usually selected as working days, while Saturday and Sunday are unselected. This
configuration helps in generating accurate attendance and productivity reports.
Notifications
Start Stop Mail Alert
A toggle switch that enables the system to send email alerts during the start and stop of
monitoring activities. When enabled, notifications keep administrators and designated recipients
informed of regular updates such as daily reports of team.
Additional Features
The settings interface includes multiple tabs to access specialized configuration areas. The tabs
include:

Reports Section: Time Tracker Report
The Reports section in Mera Monitor provides valuable insights into team productivity and
activity. The Time Tracker report offers a detailed breakdown of how time is
spent, segregated by various time metrics. This report can be viewed at both an organizational
level and for individual team members.
Accessing and Setting Up the Time Tracker Report
To access the Time Tracker report, navigate to the "Reports" section in the Mera Monitor
dashboard and select "Time Tracker" from the report list.
Upon opening the Time Tracker report, you can customize the view and data using the following
options available at the top of the report interface:
• View Selection: You can switch between "Organization View"(only available with
Organization admin) and "Individual View" using the toggle at the top left.
o Organization View: This is the initial default view. It provides a summarized
perspective of time tracking metrics for the entire organization or specific
teams/departments. In this view, the report table lists team members, and
metrics are aggregated for the selected date range across the organization
o Individual View: To access the individual view, select the "Individual View"
toggle. This view allows you to delve into the time tracking data for a specific
team member across different dates.
• Date Range Selection: Use the date pickers to specify the date range for the report.
You can select a starting and ending date to analyze data within a chosen period. This
date range selection is consistent in both Organization and Individual Views, allowing
you to analyze data over specific days, weeks, months, or custom periods.
• Member Selection (Individual View): When in "Individual View", the Member
Selection dropdown becomes active. This dropdown allows you to select a specific
team member whose individual time tracking data you wish to examine. Clicking this
dropdown will present a list of team members to choose from.
• Filter Button: After setting your desired date range and, if applicable, selecting a
member (in Individual View) or other filters (potentially available in Organization View -
not shown in screenshots), click the "Filter" button to apply these settings and update
the report data to reflect your selections.
• Export Button: The "Export" button remains available in both views. Clicking it will
allow you to export the currently displayed report data into a downloadable format such
as CSV or Excel. This is useful for offline analysis, sharing reports, or archiving data.
Understanding the Time Tracker Report Data
The structure and presentation of data differ slightly between the Organization View and the
Individual View. Let's examine each:
In Organization View:
• The report presents data in a tabular format where each row represents a team
member. Columns display aggregated time metrics like Average Time, Active Time,
Unproductive Time, Productive Time, and Idle Time for the selected date range.
In Individual View:
The report table's structure shifts. Now, each row represents a specific date within the
selected date range. The columns then display time metrics for the selected individual
member on each of those dates. Here's a breakdown of the columns visible in the
Individual View screenshot:
o DATE: This column lists the dates within the selected date range. Each row
corresponds to a single day. In the example screenshot, only "28 Feb 2025" is
displayed as the date range is set for a single day.
o ACTIVITY SPAN: This column displays the time range for the recorded activity
on the corresponding date. In the example, it shows "12:00:00 AM - 12:00:00
AM". This might indicate the start and end of the tracked period for the day, or if
data is only available for a specific period within the day. Note: "12:00:00 AM -
12:00:00 AM" is a placeholder of no active tracking within the shown data. In a
real-world scenario, you would expect to see time spans reflecting the working
hours or tracked activity duration.
o ACTIVE TIME: This column displays the active time logged by the selected
individual on the specific date in that row. Active time is the total duration the
user was logged in and working.
o UNPRODUCTIVE TIME: This column shows the unproductive time recorded
for the selected individual on that date.
o PRODUCTIVE TIME: This column shows the productive time logged by the
selected individual on that date.
o IDLE TIME: This column displays the idle time for the selected individual on the
date. "0hrs 0Min" is shown.
o AWAY TIME: This column, newly visible in the Individual View, displays away
time. Away time might represent periods when the user was logged in but
explicitly marked themselves as "away" or was automatically detected as away
by the system (e.g., based on prolonged inactivity beyond the idle threshold, or
explicit status setting).
o TOTAL HOURS: This column displays the total tracked hours for the selected
individual on that date. This likely represents the sum of Active Time,
Unproductive Time, Productive Time, Idle Time, and potentially Away Time.
Total Productivity Summary
Above the report table, the "Total Productivity" line is displayed in both views.
• In Organization View: "Total Team Productivity" summarizes the overall productive
time for the entire team or filtered group for the selected date range.
• In Individual View: While it is still labeled "Total Productivity" in the screenshot, in the
Individual View, it likely represents the total productive time for the selected
individual for the entire selected date range. "
Navigating the Report Table
• Sorting: Both views likely allow sorting of data within the table by clicking on the column
headers (indicated by the up/down arrow icons next to column names like "DATE,"
"ACTIVE TIME," etc.). This allows you to quickly re-order the data based on your metric
of interest (e.g., sort by date, or by productive time in descending order).
• Pagination: If the report contains more data than can be displayed on a single page,
pagination controls will be available below the table. Use these controls to navigate
through multiple pages of data.
Interpreting the Time Tracker Report
The Time Tracker report, in both Organization and Individual Views, is a powerful tool for
understanding time utilization.
• Organization View Interpretation: Use this view to get a high-level understanding of
team productivity. Identify top and bottom performers in terms of productive time
allocation. Analyze overall team active, unproductive, and idle time trends. This view is
beneficial for managers and administrators to get a pulse on overall team efficiency.
• Individual View Interpretation: Use this view to deep-dive into the time management
habits of specific team members. Analyze how a particular individual spends their time
across different days. Identify patterns in their productive and unproductive time on a
day-to-day basis. This view is useful for managers to understand individual workloads,
identify potential bottlenecks, or coach individuals on time management. Individuals can
also use this view for self-reflection and personal productivity improvement.
Reports Section: Websites & Applications Report
The Websites & Applications report in Mera Monitor provides a detailed overview of the
websites and applications used by your team members. This report helps you understand which
tools are being utilized, the time spent on each, and their classification as productive or
unproductive. This information is crucial for analyzing work patterns and optimizing resource
allocation.
Accessing the Websites & Applications Report
To access this report, navigate to the "Reports" section on the Mera Monitor dashboard and
select "Web And Apps" from the list of report options.
Once you open the "Websites & Applications" report, you will see several options to customize
the report's view and data:
• View Selection: Similar to the Time Tracker report, you can choose between
"Organization View" and "Individual View" using the toggle at the top left of the report
interface.
o Organization View (Default): This view provides an aggregated summary of
website and application usage across the organization or a selected group. It lists
all websites and applications accessed by the team, along with total time spent
on each and their productivity classification. This is the view shown in the
provided screenshot.
o Individual View: While not visible in this screenshot, the "Individual View" option
will likely allow you to focus on the website and application usage of a specific
team member. This would provide a detailed breakdown of the websites and
applications used by an individual, similar to the individual view in the Time
Tracker report.
• Date Range Selection: Use the date pickers at the top right to define the date range for
the report. Select a start and end date to analyze data within a specific timeframe. You
can adjust this to view daily, monthly, or custom date ranges.
• Search Functionality: The "Search" bar at the top left allows you to search for specific
websites or applications by name. Typing in the search bar will dynamically filter the
report to display only entries that match your search query.
• Member Selection: The dropdown menu lets you select the member. In "Organization
View", this dropdown allows you to filter the report to show data for specific teams and
departments. Clicking this dropdown will reveal available filtering options based on your
organization's structure and user roles.
• Tabular Filters: "All Websites", "Websites", "Applications": Just below the search
bar, you will see tabs labeled "All", "Websites", and "Applications". These act as
filters for the report data:
o All (Selected in Screenshot): When "All" is selected, the report displays a
combined list of both websites and applications accessed during the specified
date range.
o Websites: Selecting "Websites" will filter the report to show only websites
accessed by the team.
o Applications: Selecting "Applications" will filter the report to show only
applications used by the team.
Understanding the Websites & Applications Report Data
The report data is presented in a table format. Each row represents a website or application,
and columns provide details about its usage. Here's a breakdown of the columns visible in the
Organization View screenshot:
• WEBSITES/APPS: This column lists the names of the websites or applications
accessed. For websites, the URL might be displayed, while for applications, the
application name is shown.
• TIME SPENT: This column displays the total time spent by the team (in Organization
View) on each website or application during the selected date range. Time is typically
displayed in "hours and minutes" format.
• PRODUCTIVE / UNPRODUCTIVE: This column indicates the classification of each
website or application as either "Productive" or "Unproductive". This classification is
determined by the organization's admin in the Activity Classification settings. This
column provides crucial context on whether the time spent on each tool is considered
work-related or potentially distracting.
• ACTION: This column contains a "View" button for each website or application entry.
Clicking the "View" button for a specific website or application will likely lead to further
detailed information about its usage. This might include:
o A breakdown of usage by individual team members.
o Trends in usage over time for that specific tool.
o Potentially, more granular data related to activity within that specific website or
application (depending on system capabilities - further view page screenshots
would be needed to confirm).
Desktop Application Flow for Data to Server
1. Initial Validation and Setup
The worker service begins by performing the following steps:
• API Token Validation: The system validates the API token to ensure the request is
authorized. If the token is invalid, the service returns an authorization error and halts
further processing.
• Daily Table Check: The service checks if the respective daily table in the database
contains any records to process. If no records are found, the system waits for a defined
interval before rechecking.
• User Data Retrieval: If records are present, the service retrieves a list of users whose
data is available in the daily table for processing.
2. Processing Data for Each User
The service processes data for each user one by one. The data is divided into two main
categories: screen activity data and keystroke/mouse click data.
a. Screen Activity Data Processing
The system processes screen activity data as follows:
• Grouping Screen Activities:
o Screen activities are grouped based on similar app names, titles, and URLs.
o The time interval between two activities in a group should not exceed twice the
capturing interval.
• Updating User Tables:
o The grouped activities are inserted or updated in the User Screen Activity
Table to provide detailed reporting.
o The User Daily Activity Table is updated by:
▪ Calculating the "away time" between two grouped activities.
▪ Identifying the first and last activity times for the day.
o The User Daily Productivity Table is updated by categorizing screen activities
into productive and unproductive groups.
• Data Cleanup: After processing, all data related to screen activities for the current user
is removed from the Daily Screen Activity Table.
b. Keystroke and Mouse Click Data Processing
The system processes keystroke and mouse click data in the following steps:
• Recording Key and Mouse Counts:
o Key and mouse counts are inserted into the User Key and Mouse Activity
Between Screenshot Table, based on the screenshot interval and the last
processed record.
o Counts are also inserted into the User Key and Mouse Activity Table, based on
the graph interval and the last processed record.
• Identifying Idle Time:
o Idle time is calculated by determining the time difference between the current
key/mouse count records and the last processed record.
o All identified idle records are processed further.
• Processing Idle Records:
o For each idle record:
▪ The system retrieves all activities within the idle period.
▪ It calculates the "away time" between these activities.
▪ If the "away time" exceeds 1 minute but still falls under idle criteria, the
idle record is split into smaller segments.
• Finalizing Idle Records:
o The User Productivity Table is updated to reduce idle time from the respective
app or URL.
o The User Daily Activity Table is updated to add the calculated idle time.
o Idle records are inserted into the User Daily Idle Activity Table, associating
them with the app or URL with the highest idle time.
• Data Cleanup: After processing, all data related to keystrokes and mouse clicks for the
current user is removed from the Daily Key Mouse Activity Table.
3. Iterative Processing
The service repeats the above steps for each user in the list until all user data has been
processed.
Summary of Key Tables Used in the Flow
1. Daily Tables:
a. Store raw data for screen activities, keystrokes, and mouse clicks.
b. Data is processed and removed after completion.
2. User Screen Activity Table:
a. Stores grouped screen activities for detailed reporting.
3. User Daily Activity Table:
a. Tracks daily activity, including away time, idle time, and first/last activity times.
4. User Daily Productivity Table:
a. Categorizes activities into productive and unproductive groups.
5. User Key and Mouse Activity Tables:
a. Record key and mouse counts based on screenshot and graph intervals.
6. User Daily Idle Activity Table:
a. Stores idle records, associating them with the app or URL with the highest idle
time.
Desktop Application Login & Data Capture Flow
1. User Authentication
The application begins by verifying the user's credentials:
• Check Local Database: The system first checks if the user's credentials exist in the
local database.
o If the credentials are not found, the application displays the login screen for the
user to enter their credentials.
• Authenticate User: Once the user enters their credentials, the system validates them by
authenticating with the server.
o If the credentials are valid, the system proceeds to the next step.
o If the credentials are invalid, the user is prompted to re-enter their credentials.
2. Configuration and Initialization
After successful authentication, the application sets up the environment:
• Validate API Token: The system validates the API token to ensure the user is
authorized to access the application.
• Set Configuration Parameters: The application loads and sets configuration
parameters required for operation.
• Set and Start Timers: Timers are initialized and started for various activities, such as
capturing screenshots, logging activity, and uploading data.
• Load Project and Tasks: The system loads the user's active projects and tasks for
tracking purposes.
• Load Recent Sessions: The application retrieves and displays the user's recent
sessions for reference.
3. Data Collection
The application collects data based on user activity through various triggers:
• On Upload: Data is uploaded to the main database at regular intervals or when
triggered manually.
• On Screen Activity: The system monitors active applications and captures details such
as the application name, title, and URL (if applicable, e.g., for browsers). This data is
stored in memory for further processing.
• On Screenshot Timer Tick: Screenshots are captured at regular intervals and stored in
